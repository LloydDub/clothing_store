          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to your Avease Vendor Portal! This guide will help you
            understand how to get the most out of the Avease platform, as well
            as how to officially set up products and maintain your e-commerce
            platform while utilizing its features.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should have received an invitation to sign in to the Vendor
            Portal. Here, you can add products, view analytics, send feedback to
            the Avease team, and invite your merchandising team members for
            collaboration.
          </p>

        <section id="platform-overview">
          <h2>Platform Overview</h2>

          <h3>Dashboard</h3>
          <p>
            Once you create your Avease account, you’ll be greeted by your
            dashboard. The dashboard provides a high-level snapshot of your top
            products, total transaction volume, active products, and inactive
            products.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the dashboard, you can set custom time periods to view try-on
            analytics and track your top-performing products, including the
            number of try-ons for each item.
          </p>

          <h3>Product Feed</h3>
          <p>
            The product feed is where you can view all of your garments and
            filter them by active or inactive status. You can also use the
            search field to locate individual products by name or SKU.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the product feed, you can add individual products to your
            online store. Instructions on how to add products will be covered in
            a dedicated section.
          </p>

          <h3>Send Feedback</h3>
          <p>
            Your feedback is important to us! That’s why we provide a dedicated
            feedback form for our valued partners to report bugs or submit
            feature requests. In addition to the feedback form, multiple
            channels of communication are available to vendors to address any
            issues or concerns quickly.
          </p>

        <section id="setup">
          <h2>Setup</h2>
          <p>
            The Setup section is where the main functionality of the platform
            resides. Here, you’ll find all the tools and resources needed to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Add the Avease script to your website.</li>
            <li>Format and upload your product data via CSV.</li>
            <li>Enable sizing recommendations using sizing charts.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each of these features will be explained in greater detail in the
            following sections.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="team">
          <h2>Team</h2>
          <p>
            The Team section is where you can invite your merchandising or web
            team members to collaborate on the Avease platform
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="avease-integration">
          <h2>Avease Integration</h2>
          <p>
            This section will cover the specifications for adding Avease to your
            online store.
          </p>

          <h3>Adding the script</h3>
          <p>
            Integration will require adding a script with your personal widget
            key. The Widget key is located in the Widget integration section and
            the provided script automatically includes your widget key for ease
            of use.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Script below is inserted in the body of the garment’s page as
            shown in the example below
          </p>
          <pre><code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
   &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
   &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Cool T-Shirt&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" /&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;script&gt;
     (function (w, d, s, o, f, js, fjs) {
       w["Avease-Widget"] = o;
       w[o] =
         w[o] ||
         function () {
           (w[o].q = w[o].q || []).push(arguments);
         };
       (js = d.createElement(s)), (fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]);
       js.id = o;
       js.src = f;
       js.async = 1;
       fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
     })(
       window,
       document,
       "script",
       "av",
       "https://widget-staging-avease.nexxtdevelopment.ca/assets/snippet.js"
     );
     av("config", { id: "Your Key here" });
     av("init");
   &lt;/script&gt; 
                </code></pre>

          <h3>Setting up the Embedded HTML Snippet</h3>
          <p>
            To integrate the Avease virtual try-on experience directly into your
            product pages, you'll need to embed a small piece of HTML code. This
            code snippet acts as a placeholder for the Avease try-on button and
            functionality.
          </p>
          <h4>Code Implementation:</h4>
          <p>
            Copy and paste the following code into the desired location on your
            product page:
          </p>
          <pre><code>&lt;div data-widget-id="avease-widget-loc" data-product-sku={YOUR_PRODUCT_SKU}&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
          <h4>Important Note:</h4>
          <p>
            Replace {YOUR_PRODUCT_SKU} with the actual SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)
            of the product displayed on that specific page. This ensures that
            the try-on experience is linked to the correct product.
          </p>

          <h3>Setup Complete</h3>
          <h4>Verification:</h4>
          <p>
            After embedding the code snippet, you can verify the successful
            integration of the Avease widget by following these steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the product page where you embedded the code.</li>
            <li>Locate the "Try On With Avease" button.</li>
            <li>Click the button.</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Expected Behavior:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>A pop-up iframe should appear.</li>
            <li>
              The iframe will prompt you to sign in to your Avease account (if
              you haven't already).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Troubleshooting:</h4>
          <h5>Button Not Appearing:</h5>
          <p>
            If the "Try On With Avease" button is not visible on your product
            page, it's likely due to an issue with the product's status in your
            Product Feed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ensure that the product you are viewing is active in the Product
            Feed.
          </p>
          <h4>Additional Considerations:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Product Feed: The Avease system relies on a product feed to sync
              product information. Make sure your product feed is up-to-date and
              that the product you're trying to view is included and marked as
              "active."
            </li>
            <li>
              Browser Compatibility: The Avease widget is designed to work with
              modern web browsers. If you're experiencing issues, try using a
              different browser or clearing your browser's cache and cookies.
            </li>
            <li>
              JavaScript: The Avease widget relies on JavaScript to function.
              Ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your browser settings.
            </li>
            <li>
              Network Connectivity: A stable internet connection is required for
              the Avease widget to load and function properly.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What is the Product Feed?</h3>
          <p>
            The product feed is a centralized hub where you can view and manage
            all the product data you've uploaded onto the platform. This data is
            crucial for displaying your products correctly and enabling features
            like fit recommendations.
          </p>
          <p>There are two primary ways to upload your product data:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Bulk Upload: If you have a large catalog, you can upload products
              in batches using a CSV file. This is done through the "Upload
              Product Data" section.
            </li>
            <li>
              Individual Entry: For adding or editing single products, you can
              use the "Product Feed page" to input the details manually.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Data Retrieval and Formatting</h3>
          <p>
            To ensure that the platform can efficiently retrieve and display
            your product data, and to leverage features like fit
            recommendations, it's essential to format your data with specific
            attributes. Think of these attributes as tags that provide key
            details about each product.
          </p>
          <h4>Essential Product Attributes</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              SKU: This is a unique code that identifies each product in your
              inventory.
            </li>
            <li>
              Title: The name of the product as it will be displayed to
              customers.

              (e.g., Clothing, Shoes, Accessories).
            </li>
            <li>
              Product Group ID: This ID is used to group product variants
              together (e.g., different sizes and colors of the same shirt).
            </li>
            <li>Size: The size of the product (e.g., S, M, L, XL).</li>

            <li>
              Gender: The gender the product is designed for (e.g., M, F).

              (e.g., Top, Bottom, Full Body, Dress).

              Sizing Category Type: Additional sizing details within the
              category (e.g., Short, Long).

          </ul>
          <p>
            <li>
              Sizing Category: The broad category of how the product is sized
              (e.g., Top, Bottom, Full Body, Dress).
            </li>
            <li>
              Sizing Category Type: Additional sizing details within the
              category (e.g., Short, Long).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Note: The attributes related to gender, sizing category, and sizing
            category type are mandatory if you want to utilize the fit
            recommendation feature for your products.
          </p>

          <h3>FAQs</h3>
          <h4>
            1. Do I need to format my product data if I'm using Google Merchant
            Center?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Yes, even if you're using Google Merchant Center to manage your
            product data, you'll still need to incorporate the Avease-specific
            attributes mentioned above. These are essential for generating
            accurate fit recommendations and ensuring optimal product display on
            the Avease platform.
          </p>
          <h4>
            2. I have a large number of products that don't have the required
            formatting. Is there any easy way for me to update these?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, there isn't a bulk update feature for reformatting
            your product data at this time. You'll need to either:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Manually Edit the CSV: If you initially uploaded your products via
              CSV, you can edit the file to include the missing attributes and
              then re-upload it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Update Products Individually: Use the Product Feed page to edit
              each product and add the required information one by one.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While this might be a time-consuming process, ensuring your product
            data is correctly formatted will significantly enhance the customer
            experience and potentially increase sales through features like
            personalized fit recommendations.

            results.
